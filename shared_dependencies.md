Shared Variables:
1. `env_name`: The name of the Conda environment to be created or used. Shared across all files.
2. `pkg_input`: The string or filename that specifies the packages to be installed and their sources. Shared across all files.
3. `failed_pkgs`: An array to store the names of packages that fail to install. Shared across "package_installation.py", "error_handling.py", "logging.py", and "install_conda_pkgs.py".
4. `env_exists`: A variable that stores whether the specified Conda environment already exists. Shared across "conda_env_setup.py" and "install_conda_pkgs.py".
5. `pkgs_r`: A string to store R package names and their sources in a named list format. Shared across "install_r_pkgs.py" and "install_conda_pkgs.py".
6. `conda_pkgs` and `pip_pkgs`: Arrays to store the names of Conda and Pip packages, respectively. Shared across "package_installation.py", "install_conda_pkgs.py", "install_pip_pkgs.py".

Function Names:
1. `install_conda_pkgs`: The main function that orchestrates the package installation process. Defined in "install_conda_pkgs.py" and called in other files as needed.
2. `install_r_pkgs`: A function to install R packages. Defined in "install_r_pkgs.py" and called in "install_conda_pkgs.py".
3. `install_pip_pkgs`: A function to install Pip packages. Defined in "install_pip_pkgs.py" and called in "install_conda_pkgs.py".

File Names:
1. "install.log": A file to log the installation process and any errors. Used in "logging.py" and "install_conda_pkgs.py".
2. "failed_r_packages.txt": A file to write the names of failed R packages. Used in "error_handling.py" and "install_conda_pkgs.py".

Other Shared Elements:
1. Package sources: CRAN, Bioconductor, GitHub, conda-forge, r, bioconda. These are used across multiple files to specify where to install packages from.
2. Conda commands: `conda env list`, `conda activate`, and `conda install`. These are used in "conda_env_setup.py" and "install_conda_pkgs.py" to manage the Conda environment and install packages.
