The shared dependencies between the files "setup_R_environment.sh" and "pkg_file.txt" are:

1. Variables:
   - `env_name`: The name of the conda environment to be created or activated.
   - `pkg_file`: The file containing the list of packages to be installed.
   - `env_exists`: A variable to check if the specified conda environment already exists.
   - `pkgs_r`: A string to hold the list of R packages to be installed.
   - `key` and `value`: Variables used to read the package name and source from the package file.
   - `channel`: Variable used to iterate over the conda channels when installing a package via conda.

2. Data schemas:
   - The format of the package file (pkg_file.txt) is `package=source`, where package is the name of the R package to be installed and source is the repository from which to install the package (CRAN, Bioconductor, GitHub, or conda).

3. Function names:
   - `setup_R_environment`: The main function that sets up the R environment and installs the packages.
   - `conda create`, `conda activate`, `conda run`, `conda install`: Conda commands used to create and activate the conda environment, and to install packages via conda.
   - `Rscript`: Command used to run the R script that installs the R packages.
   - `install.packages`, `BiocManager::install`, `devtools::install_github`: R functions used to install packages from CRAN, Bioconductor, and GitHub respectively.

4. Message names:
   - Various messages are logged to the file "install.log" during the execution of the script, such as the creation and activation of the conda environment, the installation of packages, and any errors that occur during the installation process.
